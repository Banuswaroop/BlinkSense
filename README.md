BlinkSense is an AI-powered real-time eye blink detection system designed to help individuals with motor disabilities interact with technology using only eye blinks. Built using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Flask, it detects left/right eye blinks from a webcam feed and performs actions such as generating random letters â€” useful for communication and control in assistive devices.
